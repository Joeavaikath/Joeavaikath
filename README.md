### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I like computers. I like video games, and am fascinated by the computers that run said video games.
I like algorithms, graphs and the mathematical intuitions behind them.
I am currently studying more about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. I am taking a course from NCSU, and an online Coursera course from DeepLearning.ai
I like sunny days and slightly chilly weather.

I think myself into knots, so I'll stop now.
